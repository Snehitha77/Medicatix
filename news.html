        Food allergy (FA) is an adverse health effect arising from a specific immune response that is reproducible following ingestion of a given food. <br>
        Food allergy can be categorized into IgE-mediated and nonâ€“IgE-mediated, based on the pathophysiology of the reaction. In this mini-review we <br>
        will be focusing on IgE-mediated FA and updates from recent trials and newer modes of treatment that are emerging.With prevalence increasing <br>
        over the last couple of decades, the multifaceted burdens associated with food allergy and the  negative effects on quality of life for patients<br>
        and their families highlights the importance for the continued search for more specific treatment options.<br>
        <br>
        Since the first randomized control trial (RCT) demonstrated efficacy in oral immunotherapy (OIT)over 20 years ago,numerous clinical trials have<br>
       emerged looking into various approaches for the  treatment of IgE-mediated FA.Though there is now a regulatory approved OIT product available<br>
      for peanut allergy in the United States and Europe, the standard of care for all other food allergens remains  strict avoidance. While OIT has <br>
      been effective,more effective preparations, dose, use of adjuvants, novel routes of immunotherapy and identifying patients most likely to benefit <br>
      from immunotherapy.The two most studied alternative routes to OIT are sublingual (SLIT) and epicutaneous  immunotherapy (EPIT).<br>
      <br>
      Multiple adjuvant agents have been tested in the context of improving benefit-risk ratio,from probiotics, to adjuvant medications (e.g., montelukast, <br>
      antihistamines, and biologic treatments). There have also been studies looking into the efficacy of biologics as monotherapy. In the following text,<br>
      we will summarize both the foundational clinical trials as well as highlight some of the more recent clinical trials that are underway for the different<br>
      modes of treatment in food allergy.<br>
